# CMGA: Cross-Task Meta-Learning Network With Graph-Enhanced Attention Module for Hyperspectral Change Detection

# Usage
we have uploaded the pretrained parameters of the model in the folder "pre_trained_gnn". To use the model, you can simply run the following command:

run meta_demo.py

If you have any questions, you can send me an email and I will reply in time.
